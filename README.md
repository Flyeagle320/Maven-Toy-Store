Hi All . Few days back I came across data playground page by Maven Analytics where I got interesting data set of fictional toy store .

In this below point are being covered .



1.Created a comprehensive dashboard which includes recommended, revenue, and profit dashboards.

a. Recommended : In this I have included visual recommended by maven such as Category Wise Profit , Sales pattern , Inventory days , OOS situation in stores in particular cities 

b. Revenue : Revenue by Store location , MOM sales , Also 5 top and bottom cities based on revenue .

c. Profit : 

Profit by Store location , Also 5 top and bottom High Qty product.   



2. Utilized advanced analytics techniques to deliver key metrics and KPIs, such as sales revenue, profitability, and top-selling products.



Based on my findings from this dashboard 

1. Downtown stores bring maximum revenue of 8.2 Million and profit of 57% . Most profitable and high revenue store is Maven Toys Ciudad de Mexico 2 with 49% profit 

2. When it come Sales pattern in 2017 there frequent drop in profit margin in April , June , July But improved in 2018 for same months whereas there was increase in revenue as well for mentioned month .
